# Torch-facing layer for the DeepSeek V4 sparse attention kernels: the `prime_rl::dsv4_sparse_attn`
# and `prime_rl::dsv4_sparse_attn_backward` custom ops, their fake (meta) implementations, and the
# autograd rule that ties them together and forms the attention-sink gradient in torch. The
# TileLang kernels themselves live in `dsv4_sparse_attn_fwd.py` and `dsv4_sparse_attn_bwd.py`; this
# module is the only place that knows both exist.

# TileLang ships a libcudart stub that proxies to the real CUDA runtime via
# dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, ...).  If the stub's own symbols are the first ones found
# (because nothing loaded the real libcudart globally yet), the self-check fails
# and the stub calls abort().  Pre-loading the real library with RTLD_GLOBAL
# ensures dlsym finds it before the stub's own exports.
